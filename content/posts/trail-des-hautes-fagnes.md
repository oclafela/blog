In preparation for the Trail del Cinghiale, I decided to enrol for the <a href="https://www.traildeshautesfagnes.be/fr/">Trail Des Hautes Fagnes</a>. Three different formats were available: Trail (38km, 1.200+), Middle (24km, 700+), and Mini (13km, 385+). I decided to participate in the Middle, an excellent short race before the Trail Vallées du Chevalier I’ll run next weekend.

![Alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/oclafela/blog/main/images/bivio.jpg "The three different formats available for the Trail Des Hautes Fagnes")

If you divide the number of kilometres for the price, it is basically for free. Furthermore, this event was an excuse to run together with other people instead of doing a half-marathon on my own close to home.

I was confident of finishing the race, but, as always, I didn’t pay too much attention to nutrition and sleeping the days before. As a result, I didn’t feel in excellent shape, and I also had to drive there that morning. It took me a bit less than two hours, and I think it slightly affected my performance. I’m not looking for excuses, just being honest.

The organisation was excellent. The race started and arrived at the Xhoffraix Football Club. Facilities were available to the runners: parking spots, showers and locker rooms, food, drinks, and a small COVID test centre. Furthermore, the cloudy weather was perfect, with 22 degrees and no rain. The sun appeared after I took my shower, as I was drinking a beer.

The runners were grouped for the first 5 kilometres, and I followed the flow, running faster than expected. After that, there was a tough climb, and I started having some lactic acid problems in my right calf. I started drinking the water I had, and at the aid station located at km 8, I took on board some isotonic drinks and pieces of banana; problem solved.

The race route was so beautiful. I ran almost the entire race in forests, with some small rivers to cross. The path was well marked, and members of the organisation were located in the crucial points supporting the runners. The second staging point was at kilometre 16, just before another climb. I enjoyed the experience, and I ran for most of the time. There was room for me to push a bit harder than I did, but in the end, I was satisfied with my performance.

I invite everyone to enrol for next year’s event; you will not regret it. Live and learn:
* dedicate more attention to nutrition;
* don’t push yourself too much over your limits, especially at the beginning of a race; and,
* reserve one training session every week for climbs.

So there are the mistakes. Not that any of them are surprising, but I didn’t think it would take such a high toll.
