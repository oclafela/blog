On my way to getting ready for the Trail del Cinghiale in November, I decided to enrol for the <a href="https://www.traildeshautesfagnes.be/fr/">Trail Des Hautes Fagnes</a>. Three different formats were available: Trail (38km, 1.200+), Middle (24km, 700+), and Mini (13km, 385+). I decided to participate in the Middle, an excellent short race before the Trail Vallées du Chevalier I’ll run next weekend.

The cost of the Middle was 7 Euro: if you compare the price for the number of kilometres, it was basically for free. Furthermore, this event was an excuse to run together with other people instead of having a half-marathon on my own nearby my place.

I was confident of finishing the race, but, as always, I didn’t pay too much attention to nutrition and sleeping the days before. As a result, I didn’t feel in excellent shape, and I also had to drive there that morning. It took me a bit less than two hours, and I think it slightly affected my performance. I’m not looking for excuses, just being realistic.

The organisation was excellent. The race started and arrived at the Xhoffraix Football Club pitch. The facilities were available to the runners: many parking spots, showers and locker room, food, drinks, and a small COVID test centre. Furthermore, the cloudy weather was perfect, with 22 degrees and no rain. The sun appeared after I took my shower, and I was drinking a beer.

The runners were united for the first 5 kilometres, and I just followed the flow, running faster than expected. After that, there was a thought climb, and I started having some lactic acid problems in my right calf. I drank the water I had, and at the nutrition point located at kilometres 8, I had isotonic drinks and pieces of banana; problem solved.

The race route was so beautiful. I ran almost the entire race in forests, with some small rivers to cross. The path was well marked, and members of the organisation were located in the crucial points supporting the runners. The second nutrition point was at kilometre 16, just before another climb. I enjoyed the experience, and I ran for most of the time. There was room for me to push a bit harder than what I’ve done, but in the end, I was satisfied with my performance.

I come back home with this observation:
* dedicate more attention to nutrition;
* don’t push too much over my limits, especially at the beginning of a race; and,
* reserve one training session every week to climbs.

So there are the mistakes. Not that any of them are surprising, but I didn’t think it would take such a high toll. Let's see if next week I'll apply this suggestions.
