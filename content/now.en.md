This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now page</a>. The last time I updated this page was on July 8, 2022.

### living <a id="living"></a>
Luxembourg, a tiny (but lovely) country, has been hosting me since May 2020. The city is beautiful; public transportation is free; there are numerous public parks and forests; and you can speak Italian everywhere (almost). But the place is even too small, and I require new motivation. I'll try to have defined my future by the end of 2022.

### learning <a id="learning"></a>
I'm studying at the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open University</a>, pursuing my Business Management bachelor's degree as a part-time student (six years in total, 2019-2025). I'm finishing up the "B207 Shaping Business Opportunities" module, which will put me halfway through my studies!

### working <a id="working"></a>
I left <a href="https://www.satispay.com/en-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satispay</a> in March 2022 after 7 years as Chief Information Officer, having lived through the startup-unicorn phases. I joined <a href="https://www.PPRO.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PPRO</a> in April 2022 as an Outsourcing & 3rd Party Manager; the role is challenging considering the company's size and complexity.

### running <a id="running"></a>
I decided to do it seriously since I was dedicating quite a lot of time to running, but I was getting fatter. So since November 2021, I'm following the advice of a <a href="https://www.fabrizioangelini.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritionist</a>, and I started working with a <a href="https://trailrunningcoaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coach</a>. Check out my signs of progress on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/16418038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a>.

### reading <a id="reading"></a>
I'm not reading, but I buy a book per week. So I have a long reading queue of books I’ve bought over the last few years; please don’t suggest something new. I promise to read more, tracking it on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89459057-oclaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goodreads</a>.
