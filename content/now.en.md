This is a <a href="https://nownownow.com/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now page</a>, and if you have your own site, you should make one, too. I updated this page for the last time the 25th of December, 2021; feel free to consider it as a Christmas gift.

### living <a id="living"></a>
The tiny (but beautiful) Luxembourg has been hosting me since May 2020. The city is lovely; public transportations are for free; many public parks and forests; you can speak Italian everywhere (almost). But a year and a half are probably enough for a tiny place, isn't it? Ps Luxembourg is between France, Belgium and Germany, in case you're wondering (I know you're).

### learning <a id="learning"></a>
I'm studying at the <a href="https://www.open.ac.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Open University</a>, pursuing my Business Management bachelor's degree as a part-time student (six years in total, 2019-2025). I’m attending the “B207 Shaping business opportunities” module; once completed, I'll be halfway through my studies!

### working <a id="working"></a>
I'm part of the <a href="https://www.satispay.com/en-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Satispay</a> team, working on revolutionise everyday transactions by making payments as easy, cheap and secure as possible. As the Chief Information Officer, I do a lot of different and exciting stuff. In case you're still paying in cash during a pandemic, give Satispay a chance and get a 5 Euro welcome bonus using <a href="https://www.satispay.com/en-it/promo/?promo=ALE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ALE</a> as a promo code.

### running <a id="running"></a>
I decided to do it seriously since I was dedicating quite a lot of time to running, but I was getting fatter. So since November 2021, I'm following the advice of a <a href="https://www.fabrizioangelini.it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">nutritionist</a>, and I started working with a <a href="https://trailrunningcoaching.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">coach</a>. I'm planning the 2022 season; I’ll let you know when the calendar is ready. In the meantime, check out my signs of progress on <a href="https://www.strava.com/athletes/16418038" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Strava</a>.

### reading <a id="reading"></a>
I'm not reading, but I buy a book per week. So I have a long reading queue of books I’ve bought over the last few years; please don’t suggest something new. I promise to read more, tracking it on <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/89459057-oclaf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">goodreads</a>.
